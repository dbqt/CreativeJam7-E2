The first player plays using a pc controller. He controls a member of the tribe that has fire and ice powers. The second player is a spirit accompanying the first player in the trial. Using VR, the second player will have to look around in the spiritual world to find clues for the trial taker.

The trial is a serie of puzzles involving balance in different ways.
